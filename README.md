### Upload folder to OneDrive
```
python upload_onedrive.py --input_folder <path_to_folder>
```

`path_to_folder`: true path to folder that you want to upload

You should have `api_token_access.json` and `important_id.json` like this:
```
{
    "KC_UTP_CT":{
        "id": "",
        "drive_id": ""
    }
}
```
